# Summary

UD Erzya is the original annotation (CoNLL-U) for texts in the Erzya language,
it originally consists of a sample from a number of fiction authors writing originals in Erzya.

# Introduction

UD Erzya is the	original annotation (CoNLL-U) for texts	in the Erzya language. Texts will date back to the 1880s

# Acknowledgements

The original annotation has been performed by Jack Rueter at the University of Helsinki using morphological tools
facilitated at the Norwegian Arctic University in Tromsø and with continuous consultation from Francis Tyers. 
The idea and funding for the first three months of the project came from Anssi Yli-Jyrä, Research Fellow at
the Academy of Finland (dec. No 270354 - A Usable Finite-State Model for Adequate
Syntactic Complexity), who made it possible to work with Erzya UD.
Without the Erzya writers themselves, we would be no where…
